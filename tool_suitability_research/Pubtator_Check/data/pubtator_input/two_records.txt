OMICSDI_S-EPMC5763896|t|First case of superficial infection due to Naganishia albida (formerly Cryptococcus albidus) in Iran: A review of the literature.
OMICSDI_S-EPMC5763896|a|Background and Purpose:Naganishia albida (formerly Cryptococcus albidus) is a non-neoformans cryptococcal species rarely isolated as a human pathogen. Case report:Herein, we present the case of a 26-year-old Iranian man with a superficial cutaneous lesion in the axilla. The initial treatment for pityriasis versicolor by clotrimazole was unsuccessful. We performed skin sampling based on the standard protocol and conducted further investigations by the conventional laboratory tests and molecular analysis of the skin samples. All the mentioned analyses revealed N.albida as the causative agent of infection. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis was carried out for the isolated agent, and the patient was treated using 100 mg daily of oral itraconazole. Conclusion:N. albida can be the causative agent of some superficial infections. This is the first report on the successful detection and treatment of a superficial skin infection due to N. albida by oral itraconazole.
OMICSDI_S-EPMC3122769|t|First case of fulminant sepsis due to Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica.
OMICSDI_S-EPMC3122769|a|We report the first case of fulminant sepsis due to Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica. This case is also the first one reported in South America. We emphasize the importance of recognizing bacteria that live in the larvae of a parasitic fly as the causative agent of severe infections in homeless patients.
