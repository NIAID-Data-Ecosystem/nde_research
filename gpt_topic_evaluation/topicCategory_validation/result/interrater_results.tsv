AccessClinicalData@NIAID	ACTIV-1 IM - Immune Modulators for Treating COVID-19 - September 2023	The ACTIV-1 (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) clinical trial enrolled 1971 patients at over 80 sites in the US and Latin America between October 2020 and December 2021.  Subjects were randomized to one of the substudies currently active in the study, and then to either the investigational agent (abatacept, infliximab, cenicriviroc) or its matching placebo. The study analyses compared each active therapy against a pooled placebo population consisting of placebo recipients from all three sub-studies (those accrued during the time the sub-study was actively enrolling). The efficacy of each therapeutic agent as add-on therapy to standard of care was evaluated based on the primary endpoint of time to recovery by Day 29. Key secondary objectives of this study were mortality and clinical improvement. Comparisons of the agents among themselves was not a research objective.  The cenicriviroc (CVC) sub-study was closed to enrollment on September 3, 2021, due to futility.  Evaluations of efficacy also included 8-point Ordinal Scale, incidence, and duration of new oxygen use, and (as an exploratory assessment) National Early Warning Score (NEWS). Safety was evaluated with laboratory and adverse event assessments, as well as evaluations of extrapulmonary manifestations.  Blood was collected at select sites for future secondary research.  Trial participants were assessed daily while hospitalized through Day 29 or discharge. Outpatient follow-up study visits occurred on Days 8, 11, 15 and 29. Follow up assessments by phone occurred at Days 22 and 60 to assess clinical status and adverse events.  The results for this study are available as three separate datasets, one for each sub-study. Enrollment numbers for each sub-study, including the randomization within each sub-study (active vs. matched placebo) and the pooled placebo population for analysis, are as follows:  For Abatacept: Active Drug: 524; Matched Placebo: 214; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 525.  For Infliximab: Active Drug: 531; Matched Placebo: 215; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 530.  For CVC: Active Drug: 360; Matched Placebo: 127; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 363.	{'Infectious disease', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	{'Biotherapeutics', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	0.5	2	4	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	{'Infectious disease'}	{'Biotherapeutics'}	1.35	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.35
AccessClinicalData@NIAID	Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) - Dataset update released August 2021	ACTT is a clinical trial platform sponsored by NIAID to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The studies are a multicenter trial and will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The studies will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm.  New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.   The initial iteration of ACTT (ACTT-1) evaluated Remdesivir vs placebo.  Participants had to have a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and meet one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrollment: radiographic infiltrates by imaging study, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94% on room air, or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).   Remdesivir was administered intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose administered daily on days 2 through 10 or until hospital discharge or death. A matching placebo was administered according to the same schedule and in the same volume as the active drug. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo. There were 60 trial sites and 13 subsites: United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1).   Participants were assessed daily during their hospitalization, from day 1 through day 29. The participant’s clinical status on an eight-category ordinal scale, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and other clinical data was recorded each day. All serious adverse events and grade 3 or 4 adverse events that represented an increase in severity from day 1 and any grade 2 or higher suspected drug-related hypersensitivity reactions were recorded. Upon discharge, participants had intermittent study visits through Day 29.  The final follow-up for all participants was Day 29.	{'Infectious disease', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	{'Biotherapeutics', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	0.5	2	4	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	{'Infectious disease'}	{'Biotherapeutics'}	1.35	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.35

The studies are a multicenter trial and will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The studies will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.  ACTT-2 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to remdesivir alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized). The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. Each stage may prioritize different secondary endpoints for the purpose of multiple comparison analyses.	{'Infectious disease', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	{'Biotherapeutics', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	0.5	2	4	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	{'Infectious disease'}	{'Biotherapeutics'}	1.35	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.35
AccessClinicalData@NIAID	Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial 3 (ACTT-3) - New dataset released October 2021	This study is an adaptive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. There will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced. One independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data in all stages to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.  ACTT-3 will evaluate the combination of interferon beta-1a and remdesivir compared to remdesivir alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data.

AccessClinicalData@NIAID	Safety and Immunogenicity Study of 2019-nCoV Vaccine (mRNA-1273) for Prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19)	This is a phase I, open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, starting at 18 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at up to 3 domestic clinical research sites. One hundred and fifty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of thirteen cohorts (10 micrograms [mcg], 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg). Subjects will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliters [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2, and 4 weeks post each vaccination (Days 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post second vaccination (Days 119, 209, and 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 5 dosages in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57.	{'Infectious disease', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences'}	{'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Safety sciences', 'Vaccinology'}	0.5	2	4	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	{'Infectious disease'}	{'Vaccinology'}	1.35	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.35
AccessClinicalData@NIAID	SDY1760 – Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) - A Prospective Cohort Study to Assess Longitudinal Immune Responses in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 - Dataset Released August 2022	This was a prospective observational cohort surveillance study of approximately 1100 adult participants hospitalized with COVID-19. Detailed information was collected regarding patient history and onset of illness upon enrollment. Participants had longitudinal assessments of clinical status, and pertinent clinical data (including clinical laboratory values, radiographic findings, medication use, oxygen and ventilatory support requirements, complications, etc.) was recorded. In parallel, the study conducted serial biologic sampling for detailed immunophenotyping to provide a comprehensive picture of immune changes that occurred throughout the course of infection. The biologic samples collected for this observational study included blood, nasal swabs, and endotracheal aspirates. Participants were followed in hospital through Day 28, unless discharged earlier. If a participant required an escalation to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-level care, either within or outside of a dedicated ICU, additional samples were collected within 24 and 96 hours of care escalation. Convalescent questionnaires and biologic samples were collected at 3-month intervals up to Month 12 after discharge, if available. In addition, if a participant was discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28, attempts were made to collect additional scheduled assessments through Day 28 on an outpatient basis, if feasible.	{'Infectious disease', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Sample collections'}	{'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Sample collections', 'Immunology'}	0.5	2	4	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	{'Infectious disease'}	{'Immunology'}	1.277777777777778	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.277777777777778
ClinEpiDB	VIDA HUCS Gambia Mali Survey	"Related studies


VIDA Case Control Study
VIDA HUCS Kenya



Background: Despite considerable progress in reducing diarrhea-related mortality over the past two decades, diarrheal diseases remain the second leading cause of post-neonatal death during the first 5 years of life in developing countries. During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).
      
      At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.
      
Objectives:

To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD
To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study
To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage
To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD


Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.
      
Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018
      
Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study
      
Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list. 
      
Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-

Age 0-59 months
Belongs to the DSS
Randomly selected from the DSS database

Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.
      
Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices.
The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where.
An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

ClinEpiDB	Preventing Congenital Syphilis Cluster Randomized Trial	"Background: Maternal syphilis is associated with stillbirths, perinatal deaths, prematurity, and congenital infections and remains a major global concern, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2012, among women who were estimated to be likely to have active syphilis, only 3% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 24% in Zambia were treated. In contrast, the WHO recommends that coverage of syphilis testing and treatment of positive cases among pregnant women should each be at least 95% in order to eliminate mother-to-child transmission.
      
      While there is evidence that insufficient access to supplies hinders screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy in low-resource settings, additional interventions might be needed to overcome barriers related to health providers' behaviors regarding treatment and increase the likelihood that the supplies are used. This study assessed whether a multifaceted behavioral intervention based on previous research experience combined with the provision of supplies was more effective than providing supplies only to improve syphilis screening and treatment in seropositive pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Lusaka (Zambia).
      
Objectives: The primary objectives of the study were to determine if behavioral interventions 1) improved the likelihood that women were screened for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit, and 2) for those who screened positive, whether they were more likely to receive syphilis treatment at their first antenatal care visit. Secondary objectives included assessing:
      
The frequency with which women received screening for HIV at their first antenatal care visit
The frequency with which women received screening for anemia at their first antenatal care visit
The frequency with which women received screening for proteinuria at their first antenatal care visit


Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: 16 antenatal care clinics in the Maluku and Nsele health areas, located in the capital city-province of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were included in baseline data collection. 10 of those antenatal care clinics were included in the intervention phase. 10 clinics in health areas located within the capital province of Lusaka, Zambia were included in baseline data collection and the intervention phase.
        
Dates of Data Collection: Baseline data collection was conducted from April 1, 2015 to January 13, 2016 in the DRC and from April 13, 2015 to January 10, 2016 in Zambia. The intervention phase was conducted from February 1, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in the DRC and from February 8, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in Zambia.
        
Study Design: Cluster randomized trial
        
Eligibility Criteria: All pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the participating clinics who consented to participate were eligible to be enrolled, irrespective of their gestational age. Antenatal care was defined as care during pregnancy before the initiation of labor. A first antenatal care visit was defined as the first visit in the participating facility during the current pregnancy.
        
Study Arms: All clinics received supplies for screening and treating syphilis, including rapid tests, benzathine penicillin, and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment, as well as training on using rapid tests. The intervention arm additionally received a multifaceted strategy consisting of: 
        
Identification and training of opinion leaders among prenatal health providers, who disseminated, implemented, and maintained the best evidence practices using reminders, monitoring, and feedback. The goal was that facilitators learn: 1) priority health conditions to be screened and treated during pregnancy; 2) how to screen and manage maternal syphilis; and 3) how to effectively implement the congenital syphilis prevention program at the clinics in order to ensure all eligible women are screened and treated and that standard partner management is done.
Packaging the supplies in kits: Point-of-care rapid test kits for syphilis diagnosis with instructions for immediate treatment, if positive; Treatment kits (benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU, syringe and needle, instructions, and information on side-effects); Anaphylaxis treatment kits for emergency use if needed (resources to treat an anaphylaxis adverse reaction according to local practice guidelines).
Information on monitoring the availability of rapid tests and ensuring the availability of benzathine penicillin and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment.


        Prenatal health providers at control clinics were invited to participate in a half-day training workshop where they were given refresher concepts on the prenatal care package and maternal and congenital syphilis and were trained in syphilis case detection and management, using standard and available screening methods. 
        
Randomization: Baseline data was used in a covariate-adjusted randomization procedure (Ivers et al., 2012) to balance the intervention and control groups in regards to: (1) Number of first antenatal care visits; (2) Number of women screened for syphilis; (3) Number of women with a positive test for syphilis; (4) Number of first antenatal care visits per provider; (5) Percentage of women screened for syphilis; (6) Percentage of women positive for syphilis; (7) Country; (8) Type of Clinic. 
        
Data Collection: Data regarding the participant's obstetric and syphilis history as well as testing for syphilis, HIV, proteinuria, and anemia were collected at a participant's first antenatal care visit for their current pregnancy. Data were obtained from source documents such as antenatal care log books, antenatal cards, prevention of mother-to-child transmission books, laboratory log books, and nursing log books. Data not available in source documents were collected by interviewing the women. Participants with a positive test for syphilis who did not receive treatment during the first visit were followed up by study personnel until their estimated date of delivery to ensure that all infected women received treatment before delivery. Participants were contacted at the subsequent antenatal care visits or by phone. The list of seropositive women who did not receive treatment at the first visit was communicated monthly to the country principal investigators to be shared with local health authorities.

ClinEpiDB	GEMS1A HUAS Lite Survey	"Related studies:


GEMS1A Case Control
GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey
GEMS1 Case Control



Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1A HUAS Lite surveys was a community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Survey (HUAS) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1A Case Control study. The survey is a shortened version of the original GEMS1 HUAS survey and provides data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.
      
Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1A HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways,
      
To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden
To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance
To calculate population-based incidence rates
To compare data between the different sites
To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea


Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites:Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1A HUAS Lite, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).
      


Dates of Data Collection: December 2010- August 2011; Per protocol, each GEMS1A site conducted surveys of health care services utilization and attitudes twice a year over the course of the study.
      
Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey
      
Eligibility Criteria: Many of the HUAS Lite methods are adapted from the Generic protocol for a community-based survey on utilization of health care services for gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age.(World Health Organization. Generic protocols for: i) hospital-based surveillance to estimate the burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children and ii) a community-based survey on utilization of health care services for gastroenteritis in children. Geneva: WHO; 2002.) 
      
      However, since the catchment population at each site will have had a recent census and ongoing demographic surveillance, it was possible to randomly select children 0-59 months of age to participate in the HUAS Lite. From the census at each study site, updated by the ongoing surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census database thus should have been as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn.
      
Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an ""x"" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.
      
      A new HUAS Lite questionnaire was to be used for each child contacted. The data collected from the ~20 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices.

ClinEpiDB	Namibia rfMDA RAVC Cluster Randomized Trial - EDA data for QA	"Background: In low-endemic malaria settings, screening and
      treatment near malaria index cases (reactive case detection, RACD) is practiced for surveillance and response. However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective. 
      
Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to:
      


Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria
       transmission
Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination



Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia
      
Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017
      
Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two
      factorial design trial
      
Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below:
      


Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC.
      


RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine
       (AL)
rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL
RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl



Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.
      
      Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected. 
      
      Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover ≥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households. 
      
      Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

VDJServer	Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment	"Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells.
 Tissues were collected from women undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer. All samples were obtained after informed consent and approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

VDJServer	B cells populating the multiple sclerosis brain mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes	"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by autoimmune-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration. The CNS of patients with MS harbors expanded clones of antigen-experienced B cells that reside in distinct compartments including the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and parenchyma. It is not understood whether this immune infiltrate initiates its development in the CNS or in peripheral tissues. B cells in the CSF can exchange with those in peripheral blood, implying that CNS B cells may have access to lymphoid tissue that may be the specific compartment(s) in which CNS-resident B cells encounter antigen and experience affinity maturation. Paired tissues were used to determine whether the B cells that populate the CNS mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). High-throughput sequencing of the antibody repertoire demonstrated that clonally expanded B cells were present in both compartments. Founding members of clones were more often found in the draining CLNs. More mature clonal members derived from these founders were observed in the draining CLNs and also in the CNS, including lesions. These data provide new evidence that B cells traffic freely across the tissue barrier, with the majority of B cell maturation occurring outside of the CNS in the secondary lymphoid tissue. Our study may aid in further defining the mechanisms of immunomodulatory therapies that either deplete circulating B cells or affect the intrathecal B cell compartment by inhibiting lymphocyte transmigration into the CNS.

VDJServer	Hierarchical Clustering Can Identify B Cell Clones With High Confidence in Ig Repertoire Sequencing Data	"Adaptive immunity is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. Each clone is the progeny of a single B cell responding to Ag, with diversified Ig receptors. These receptors can now be profiled on a large scale by next-generation sequencing. Such data provide a window into the microevolutionary dynamics that drive successful immune responses and the dysregulation that occurs with aging or disease. Clonal relationships are not directly measured, but they must be computationally inferred from these sequencing data. Although several hierarchical clustering-based methods have been proposed, they vary in distance and linkage methods and have not yet been rigorously compared. In this study, we use a combination of human experimental and simulated data to characterize the performance of hierarchical clustering-based methods for partitioning sequences into clones. We find that single linkage clustering has high performance, with specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value all >99%, whereas other linkages result in a significant loss of sensitivity. Surprisingly, distance metrics that incorporate the biases of somatic hypermutation do not outperform simple Hamming distance. Although errors were more likely in sequences with short junctions, using the entire dataset to choose a single distance threshold for clustering is near optimal. Our results suggest that hierarchical clustering using single linkage with Hamming distance identifies clones with high confidence and provides a fully automated method for clonal grouping. The performance estimates we develop provide important context to interpret clonal analysis of repertoire sequencing data and allow for rigorous testing of other clonal grouping algorithms.

Mendeley	Using Agent-Based Modeling to Understand and Assess Demographic (In)Equity of Extreme Heat / Direct Sunlight Exposure In Norfolk, VA Due To Lack Of Tree Canopies	Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can result in illness and death. In urban areas of dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat, extreme heat conditions can arise regularly and create harmful environmental exposures for residents daily during certain parts of the year. Tree canopies provide shade and help to cool the environment, making mature trees with large canopies a simple and effective way to reduce urban heat. We develop a demographically representative 1 (agent): 1 (person) agent-based model to understand the extent to which different demographics of residents in Norfolk, VA are equitably shaded from extreme heat conditions during a walk on a clear summer day. We use the model to assess the extent to which the city's Tree Planting Plan will be effective in remediating any existing inequities. Our results show that inequitable conditions exist for residents (1) at different education levels, (2) at different income levels and, (3) living in different census tracts. Norfolk's Tree Planting Program effectively reduces the distance residents of all demographics walk in extreme heat. However, residents of the city at lower income levels still experience statically significantly more extreme heat exposure due to a lack of tree canopies in summer months than those at higher income levels.	{'Experimental design and studies', 'Public health and epidemiology', 'Environmental sciences'}	{'Environmental sciences'}	0.3333333333333333	1	3	1.0	0.3333333333333333	{'Experimental design and studies', 'Public health and epidemiology'}	set()	0.3333333333333333	0.0	3.0	1.0	0.3333333333333333

NCBI GEO	A novel anti-hepatitis B virus regent iCDM-34 reveals suppression of cccDNA accompanied with aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation	"Background & Aims: IFN-alpha and -gamma have been reported to suppress cccDNA via APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase activity, and CDM-3008, an IFNAR2 agonist, also suppress cccDNA through interferon signaling. In order to develop a novel anti-HBV drug for functional or complete cure, we performed in silico screening using a structure of CDM-3008-binding pocket in IFNAR2.Approach & Results: The binding pocket of CDM-3008 in IFNAR2 was determined by LC-MS/MS using a CDM-3008-based molecular probe, CDM-3095 and a recombinant protein of IFNAR2 extracellular region. We conducted in silico screening of the binding compounds fitting the steric structure of the pocket. We identified 37 compounds and named them iCDM-1–37. We found that iCDM-34 showed anti-HCV and anti-HBV activities. We measured the anti-HBV activity of iCDM-34 with or without entecavir (ETV). iCDM-34 suppressed pregenome RNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), HBsAg, and HBeAg and clearly exhibited synergistic inhibitory effects with ETV. Metabolic stability of iCDM-34 was measured in human, mouse, and rat microsomal fractions. iCDM-34 was stable in human liver microsomal fraction. Furthermore, anti-HBV activity in human hepatocyte-chimeric mice revealed that iCDM-34 was not effective as a single agent, but when combined with ETV, it suppressed HBV DNA and cccDNA compared to ETV alone. Phosphoproteome analysis showed no activation of IFN signaling with iCDM-34 treatment. Transcriptome analysis of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) revealed no increase in the expression, while downstream factors of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) showed increased expression.  Conclusion: iCDM-34 is a novel anti-HBV drug that induces AhR activation and suppresses cccDNA.Conclusion: iCDM-34 is a novel anti-HBV drug that induces AhR activation and suppresses cccDNA.
Overall, 12 samples were analyzed. PXB cells cultured in 24-well plates were infected with 3 genome equivalents per cell of HBV C_AT. After 24 days of infection, the cells were treated with DMSO, 0.3 and 30 microM iCDM-34 or 1000 IU/ml IFNalpha for 7 days (n=3)."	{'Transcriptomics', 'Virology', 'Compound libraries and screening'}	{'Virology', 'Drug discovery', 'Biomolecular simulation'}	0.2	1	5	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	{'Transcriptomics', 'Compound libraries and screening'}	{'Drug discovery', 'Biomolecular simulation'}	0.9093253968253969	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.9093253968253969
NCBI GEO	A single local delivery of paclitaxel and nucleic acids via an immunoactive polymer eliminates solid tumors and induces systemic antitumor immunity	"Despite recent advances in cancer therapy, hard-to-reach, unidentified tumors remain a significant clinical challenge. A promising approach is to treat locatable and accessible tumors locally and stimulate antitumor immunity in situ to exert systemic effects against distant tumors. We hypothesize that a local carrier of immunotherapeutics is critical to the effective activation of in-situ antitumor immunity. Here, we develop a polyethyleneimine derivative (2E’), which activates immune cells and co-delivers hydrophobic immunogenic cell death inducers and immunomodulatory nucleic acids/nucleotides. A single local administration of 2E’ or its combination with paclitaxel and PD-L1 siRNA or cyclic dinucleotide induces strong antitumor immunity, resulting in immediate regression of large established tumors, tumor-free survival, and the resistance to rechallenge and metastasis in different models. This study supports that effective in-situ induction of antitumor immunity can lead to systemic protection from distant and recurrent diseases, where 2E’ plays multiple roles as a simple and versatile carrier of immunotherapeutics.

NCBI GEO	aHDF- and PB-iPSC clones from the same individuals	"Hepatocytes generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are unprecedented resources for pharmaceuticals and cell therapy. However, little attention has so far been paid to variations among hiPSC lines in terms of their hepatic differentiation. We developed an improved hepatic differentiation protocol and compared multiple hiPSC lines. This comparison indicated that the hepatic differentiation propensity varies among sibling hiPSC clones derived from the same adult human dermal fibroblasts (aHDFs). In addition, hiPSC clones derived from peripheral blood cells (PB-iPSCs) consistently showed good hepatic differentiation efficiency, whereas many hiPSC clones from adult dermal fibroblasts (aHDF-iPSCs) showed poor hepatic differentiation. However, when we compared hiPSCs from blood and dermal fibroblasts from the same individuals, we found that variations in hepatic differentiation were largely attributable to donor differences, rather than to the types of the original cells. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed variations in hepatic differentiation, we performed microarray analyses of sibling aHDF-iPSC clones, and aHDF- and PB-iPSC clones from the same individuals.

NCBI GEO	Filtering of RNA-seq datasets and differences between cell types in global coordination of splicing and proportion of highly expressed genes	"The goal of this study was to investigate whether mammalian cell types intrinsically differ in global coordination of gene splicing and expression levels. We analyzed RNA-seq transcriptome profiles of 8 different purified mouse cell types. We found that different cell types vary in proportion of highly expressed genes and the number of alternatively spliced transcripts expressed per gene, and that the cell types that express more variants of alternatively spliced transcripts per gene are those that have higher proportion of highly expressed genes. Cell types segregated into two clusters based on high or low proportion of highly expressed genes. Biological functions involved in negative regulation of gene expression were enriched in the group of cell types with low proportion of highly expressed genes, and biological functions involved in regulation of transcription and RNA splicing were enriched in the group of cell types with high proportion of highly expressed genes. These data reveal specific candidate genes, which may be involved in global coordination of balance in the transcriptome.
The following samples were reprocessed and reanalyzed:Astrocytes, GSE52564/GSM1269903/GSM1269904Endothelial cells, GSE52564/GSM1269915/GSM1269916Cortical neurons, GSE52564/GSM1269905/GSM1269906Oligodendrocytes, GSE52564/GSM1269911/GSM1269912Microglia, GSE52564/GSM1269913/GSM1269914Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, GSE40522/GSM995525Erythroid-committed precursors Gata1 KO, GSE40522/GSM995536Libraries for all samples included two biological replicates, were prepared using polyA-selected RNA, and paired reads sequenced 100 bp from each end on HiSeq 2000 Sequencer (Illumina). The raw reads were reprocessed as follows. Reads were mapped to mouse reference genome mm10 (UCSC Genome Browser) and a comprehensive transcriptome annotation database GTF file, which was assembled by using the UCSC Table Browser Intersection utility to merge the GENCODE M4 transcripts in a non-redundant manner with the UCSC Gene Track transcripts that did not overlap more than 90% with the GENCODE transcripts. The raw reads were mapped using the TopHat/Bowtie2/Cufflinks pipeline, with -g option, to construct merged GTF file that included the annotated and novel transcript structures from all samples. Then, the IntersectBed tool (Bedtools) was used to retain only the reads that mapped to the merged GTF, which was converted to BED with Gtf2bed tool (Bedops). This filtering step allowed selecting the reads which contributed to the identified gene structures, and exclude noise and artifacts even if they mapped to the genome but did not contribute to gene structure. Next, only uniquely mapped and properly paired reads were selected using View -bq 4 -bh -f2 -F12 command (Samtools). After this step, DownsampleSam tool (Picard) was used to randomly subsample equal number of paired reads, which provided representative samples of the same size for all samples (34.6M per sample/replicate; reads count with Flagstat, Samtools). The reprocessed samples were reanalyzed as follows: The TopHat/Bowtie2/Cufflinks/Cuffdiff pipeline with -g option was used for determining normalized expression in FPKMs in each replicate of each sample with Cuffdiff’s across-sample normalization. After the cell types were segregated into two clusters based on higher or lower proportion of the highly expressed genes, the differential expression analysis was preformed between the two groups, which were treated as two conditions. For this analysis, each replicate of each cell type was assigned to one of only two cluster groups. For differential expression analysis, the Cuffdiff q-value cut off was set to 0.05.

Dryad Digital Repository	Fungicide suppression of flight performance in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and its amelioration by quercetin	As a managed agricultural pollinator, the western honey bee Apis mellifera frequently encounters agrochemicals as contaminants of nectar and pollen. One such contaminant, the fungicide boscalid, is applied at bloom in orchards for fungal floral pathogen control. As an inhibitor of complex II in the mitochondrial electron transport chain of fungi, boscalid can potentially interfere with high energy-demanding activities of bees, including flight. We designed an indoor flight treadmill to evaluate impacts of ingesting boscalid and/or quercetin, a ubiquitous phytochemical in bee food that also affects mitochondrial respiration. Boscalid reduced the wing-beat frequencies of foragers during flight but did not alter the duration of flight. At the colony level, boscalid ingestion may thereby affect overall health by reducing forager efficiency. Consumption of quercetin, by contrast, led to higher adenosine triphosphate levels in flight muscles and a higher wing-beat frequency. Consuming the two compounds together increased wing beat frequency, demonstrating a hitherto unrecognized mechanism by which dietary phytochemicals may act to ameliorate toxic effects of pesticides to promote honey bee health. In carrying out this work, we also introduce two methodological improvements for use in testing for pesticide effects on flight capacity—a “force-feeding” to standardize flight fuel supply and a novel indoor flight treadmill.	{'Agricultural science', 'Animal study', 'Environmental sciences'}	{'Agricultural science', 'Environmental sciences', 'Veterinary medicine'}	0.5	2	4	0.6666666666666666	0.6666666666666666	{'Animal study'}	{'Veterinary medicine'}	1.1428571428571428	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.1428571428571428
Dryad Digital Repository	Identifying homomorphic sex chromosomes from wild-caught adults with limited genomic resources	We demonstrate a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to identify homomorphic sex chromosomes and their homolog in a distantly related reference genome, based on noninvasive sampling of wild-caught individuals, in the moor frog Rana arvalis. Double-digest RADseq libraries were generated using buccal swabs from 30 males and 21 females from the same population. Search for sex-limited markers from the unfiltered data set (411 446 RAD tags) was more successful than searches from a filtered data set (33 073 RAD tags) for markers showing sex differences in heterozygosity or in allele frequencies. Altogether, we obtained 292 putatively sex-linked RAD loci, 98% of which point to male heterogamety. We could map 15 of them to the Xenopus tropicalis genome, all but one on chromosome pair 1, which seems regularly co-opted for sex determination among amphibians. The most efficient mapping strategy was a three-step hierarchical approach, where R. arvalis reads were first mapped to a low-coverage genome of Rana temporaria (17 My divergence), then the R. temporaria scaffolds to the Nanorana parkeri genome (90 My divergence), and finally the N. parkeri scaffolds to the X. tropicalis genome (210 My). We validated our conclusions with PCR primers amplifying part of Dmrt1, a candidate sex determination gene mapping to chromosome 1: a sex-diagnostic allele was present in all 30 males but in none of the 21 females. Our approach is likely to be productive in many situations where biological samples and/or genomic resources are limited.	{'Genome resequencing', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Genotyping experiment'}	{'Population genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Mapping'}	0.0	0	6	0.0	0.0	{'Genome resequencing', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Genotyping experiment'}	{'Population genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Mapping'}	0.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
Dryad Digital Repository	Natural hazards and wildlife health: the effects of a volcanic eruption on the Andean condor	"Volcanic eruptions produce health changes in animals that may be associated with emitted gases and deposited ashes. We evaluated whether the Puyehue–Cordón Caulle volcanic eruption in 2011 produced health changes in the threatened Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) living in the area most affected by the eruption, north-western Patagonia. We studied clinical and biochemical parameters of condors examined before and after the eruption. We also examined concentrations of different metals and metalloids in the blood of individuals sampled after the eruption. The most common clinical abnormality associated with the eruptive process was irritating pharyngitis. In condors sampled after the eruption, blood concentrations of albumin, calcium, carotenoids and total proteins decreased to levels under the reference values reported for this species. We found different chemical elements in the blood of these condors after the eruption, such as arsenic and cadmium, with the potential to produce health impacts. Thus, the health of Andean condors was affected in different ways by the eruption; remaining in the affected area appears to have been costly. However, in comparison to other animal species, the health impacts were not as strong and were mainly related to food shortages due to the decrease in availability of livestock carcasses linked to the eruption. This suggests that condors dealt relatively well with this massive event. Future research is needed to evaluate if the health changes we found reduce the survival of this species, and if the cost of inhabiting volcanic areas has any ecological or evolutionary influence on the condor’s life history.

Dryad Digital Repository	New species of Franchia and Protozigzagiceras (Ammonoidea, Middle Jurassic): the phyletic origin of Zigzagiceratinae	Three genera and seven species belonging to the subfamily Zigzagiceratinae (family Perisphinctidae) are described from the Lower Bathonian of France and Saudi Arabia. Intraspecific dimorphism is recognized. A revision of the genus Franchia proposed by Sturani (1967), based on the syntypes and new specimens from south-east France, is presented. Franchia arkelli Sturani, Franchia subalpina sp. nov., Protozigzagiceras torrensi (Sturani), Protozigzagiceras tethycum sp. nov., Protozigzagiceras flexum sp. nov. and Protozigzagiceras densum sp. nov. are described from the Digne–Castellane region of south-east France. Megazigzagiceras subarabicum, gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Dharma region of Saudi Arabia. The successive Early Bathonian species of Franchia and Protozigzagiceras herein identified in West Tethyan areas, as members of the Mediterranean–Caucasian Subrealm, formed lasting separate peramorphoclines characterized by increasing hydrodynamic coiling of the shell. In contrast, rapid proterogenesis originated and diversified the earliest Bathonian zigzagiceratin lineages, giving paedomorphic members, commonly neotenic and more scarcely progenetic. Procerites–Siemiradzkia seems to be the oldest zigzagiceratin member in the French Subalpine, Iberian and Lusitanian basins, branched off by paedomorphosis from leptosphinctins at the Bajocian–Bathonian transition. The Mediterranean–Caucasian genera Franchia, Zigzagiceras, Zigzagites and Wagnericeras branched from successive species of Protozigzagiceras, in turn, a direct derivative of Procerites. The oldest lineages of the clade Zigzagiceratinae evolved by iterative, rapid, paedomorphic changes and additional, lasting, peramorphic modifications during the Early Bathonian.	{'Population genetics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Phylogeny'}	{'Applied mathematics', 'Taxonomy'}	0.0	0	5	0.0	0.0	{'Population genetics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Phylogeny'}	{'Applied mathematics', 'Taxonomy'}	0.8018518518518519	2.0	1.5	1.0	0.8018518518518519
Dryad Digital Repository	Paternal but not maternal age influences early-life performance of offspring in a long-lived seabird	Variability in demographic traits between individuals within populations has profound implications for both evolutionary processes and population dynamics. Parental effects as a source of non-genetic inheritance are important processes to consider to understand the causes of individual variation. In iteroparous species, parental age is known to influence strongly reproductive success and offspring quality, but consequences on offspring fitness component after independence are much less studied. Based on a 37 years longitudinal monitoring of a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross, we investigate delayed effects of parental age on offspring fitness components. We provide evidence that parental age influences offspring performance beyond the age of independence. By distinguishing maternal and paternal age effects, we demonstrate that paternal age, but not maternal age, impacts negatively post-fledging offspring performance.	{'Population genetics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Data acquisition'}	{'Evolutionary biology', 'Ecology', 'Zoology'}	0.2	1	5	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	{'Population genetics', 'Data acquisition'}	{'Ecology', 'Zoology'}	0.901388888888889	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.901388888888889

NCBI GEO	Radiosensitive hematopoietic cells determine the extent of skin inflammation in experimental epidermolysis bullosa acquisita	"Animal models have enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. For these models, genetically identical, inbred mice have commonly been used. Different inbred mouse strains, however, show a high variability in disease manifestation. Identifying the factors that influence this disease variability could provide unrecognized insights into pathogenesis. We established a novel antibody transfer-induced model of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), an autoimmune disease characterized by (muco)-cutaneous blistering caused by anti-type VII collagen (COL7) autoantibodies. Blistering after anti-COL7 IgG (directed against the von-Willebrand-factor A like domain 2) transfer showed clear variability among inbred mouse strains; i.e. severe cutaneous blistering and inflammation in C57Bl/6J, and absence of skin lesions in MRL/MpJ mice. The transfer of anti-COL7 IgG into irradiated, EBA-resistant MRL/MpJ mice, rescued by transplantation with bone marrow from EBA-susceptible B6.AK-H2k mice, induced blistering. To the contrary, irradiated EBA-susceptible B6.AK-H2k mice that were rescued using MRL/MpJ bone marrow were devoid of blistering. In vitro, immune complex activation of neutrophils from C57Bl/6J or MRL/MpJ mice showed an impaired ROS release from the latter, whereas no differences were observed after PMA activation. This finding was paralleled by divergent expression profiles of immune-complex activated neutrophils from either C57Bl/6J or MRL/MpJ mice. Collectively, we demonstrate that radiosensitive cells determine the varying extent of skin inflammation and blistering in the end-stage effector phase of EBA.We used microarray to differentiate between the molecular response for the immune complex stimulated neutrophils in MRL/MpJ and C57Bl/6J mice

The mechanism of IRI involves multiple pathophysiological processes and numerous types of cells. However, a systematic and comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profile of intrahepatic cells during liver transplantation is still unclear. We performed a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 14,313 cells from liver tissues collected from pre-procurement, at the end of preservation and 2 h post-reperfusion. We made detailed annotations of mononuclear phagocyte, endothelial cell, NK/T, B and plasma cell clusters, and we described the dynamic changes of the transcriptome of these clusters during IRI and the interaction between mononuclear phagocyte clusters and other cell clusters. In addition, we found that TNFAIP3 interacting protein 3 (TNIP3), specifically and highly expressed in Kupffer cell clusters post-reperfusion, may have a protective effect on IRI. In summary, our study provides the first dynamic transcriptome map of intrahepatic cell clusters during liver transplantation at single-cell resolution.

ReframeDB	Growth-based high throughput screening of small molecule libraries against anaerobic microbial choline metabolism	"Phenotypic screening looking for growth inhibitors of E. coli when it‚Äôs cultured in minimal media containing choline as carbon source, but that don‚Äôt inhibit growth on glycerol as carbon source. Bacterial growth is the indirect phenotypic signal of TMA inhibition, which will be subsequently evaluated using a LC/MS method.
Purpose
A prevalent number of bacterial species that inhabit the human gut can utilize the dietary nutrient choline as a source of carbon and energy, while releasing trimethylamine (TMA) as a byproduct. More specifically, the cut gene cluster that contains the genes that code for choline-TMA lyase (CutC) and its activating enzyme (CutD) are responsible to cleaving choline into acetaldehyde and TMA. The former can be used as source of energy via fermentation, whereas the latter is a byproduct of this metabolism. TMA, however, gets excreted out of the human body through the liver, where it gets oxidized to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMAO has a profound effect on the host's physiology, including the onset of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes. Furthermore, the cut gene cluster is found in a prevalent number of gut commensal bacteria, which emphasizes the need to specifically target this microbial pathway. This assay, which is based on a phenotypic high throughput screening, will reveal compounds that interfere with the microbial choline utilization and its transformation into TMA by inhibiting the growth of bacteria when choline is the sole carbon-energy source.
Protocol
384-well plates will be filled with compounds previously dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 uM. Columns 1 to 22 are the experimental wells. Columns 23 and 24 are controls, containing 60 ug/mL kanamycin, and DMSO, respectively. Each compound will be screened in singlicate. Once we obtain the plates, they will be left to equilibrate in the anaerobic chamber overnight. Next, we will add 50 uL of previously reduced NCE (non-carbon essential) media containing 20 mM choline and inoculate with E. coli MS-200-1 to an initial OD600 ~ 0.1. We will measure OD600 after 7 and 20 h of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees Celsius. The compounds that inhibit growth on choline (Z-score =<-2) will be re-tested at the same concentration but in NCE media containing 2.5 g/l glycerol (as counter-screening). Those compounds that don't inhibit growth under this condition (Z-score >= 0) will be picked for dose response against TMA generation.
Readout
The OD600 of the experimental wells will be analyzed in terms of their Z-score (Zscore = [ODwell - ŒºPlate]/Œ¥plate). We will calculate the Z-prime score using the control wells (Z-prime = 1 - [3Œ¥neg-3Œ¥pos)/(Œºneg-Œºpos)]
Detection Method
for the screening and counter-screening, we will measure od600 in our spectrophotometer located in our coy anaerobic chamber. for tma assay, we will use lc/ms.

ReframeDB	hRSV High Throughput Screen	"The high throughput cell-based HTS-system based on recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus type A GFP reporter virus (hRSV-A_GFP) identifies anti-hRSV compounds. HRSV is a major cause for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients.
Purpose
hRSV is a globally distributed viral pathogen causing respiratory disease in humans.
The high throughput cell-based HTS-system employs a recombinant hRSV-A strain encoding GFP fluorescent protein as reporter. Since the GFP gene is an integral part of the modified RSV genome, GFP fluorescence reflects efficiency of RSV infection and replication. A human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) is infected with hRSV-A_GFP viruses in presence of test compounds. Subsequently, GFP-fluorescence is quantified. The intensity of GFP fluorescence reflects RSV infection efficiency and is used as a marker to quantify antiviral efficacy of test compounds. In parallel, cell viability is examined by use of an MTT test. The MTT test examines metabolic activity of cultured cells. This information is used to distinguish between compounds with antiviral activity and cytotoxic molecules which destroy cells and therefore indirectly inhibit virus infection.
Protocol
HEp-2 cells are seeded in a clear bottom 384-well plates. Compounds are added together with the virus (MOI 0.5) 24h post seeding. Synagis, an antibody against the pre-fusion hRSV F-protein, is used as an inhibitory control and same volume of DMSO is used as the neutral control.

ReframeDB	Macrophage cytotoxicity	"Secondary assay: A high content microscopy assay to determine cytotoxicity of drugs against macrophages
Purpose
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, exists in a complex set of environments both intracellularly and extracellularly in the host. Most drug screening for tuberculosis has been performed on extracellular bacteria. We are screening for drugs that inhibit M. tuberculosis growth inside macrophages, a primary cell type in which the bacteria reside. This is a high-content image-based assay. Total fluorescence intensity of DsRed-producing M. tuberculosis and nucleic acid-stained macrophages are readouts of growth or survival.
Protocol
RAW 264.7 cells are propagated in RMPI ( RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 2 mM Glutagro, 1 mM sodium pyruvate medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 37Â°C, 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells are infected with M. tuberculosis (H37Rv DREAM8 strain which constitutively expresses DsRed) at multiplicity of infection of 1.0 overnight. Compounds are diluted in RPMI-1640, 5% FBS with Glutagro and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Infected RAW 264.7 cells are harvested with Accumax solution, washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular bacilli and resuspended in RPMI-1640 with Glutagro and sodium pyruvate (no FBS). Infected cells are  seeded in 384-well plates containing compounds at 3.3 x 10^3 cells per well, resulting in a final assay concentration of 2.5% FBS. After a 72 hour incubation period, SYBR Green I dye is diluted in PBS and added to a final concentration of 5x to stain macrophage nuclei. Cells are imaged on an ImageXpress Micro with a 4x objective. Macrophage nuclei are imaged using a FITC filter set and M. tuberculosis are imaged using a Texas Red filter set. This method has been published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316303619?via%3Dihub

Images were analyzed by setting a lower bound for pixel intensity for each channel to define nuclei and bacteria above background.The integrated pixel intensity of each channel above this threshold was then determined as a measure of macrophage or M. tuberculosis  growth. Raw data were normalized to the average integrated intensity value from DMSO treated wells and expressed as % growth.

ReframeDB	Screen for Balamuthia growth inhibitors	"Secondary Assay: Identification of growth inhibitors of Balamuthia mandrillaris via luminescence cell-based assay
Purpose
Balamuthia mandrillaris is an opportunistic pathogen, generally entering through broken skin or through the respiratory pathway, where it can cause lesions. Infection of the brain is thought to occur secondarily from these sites after penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and can cause GAE with a mortality rate up to 95%. In our screen we incubated the B. mandrillaris trophozoites with the compounds for 72 hours and assessed viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of luminescence signal compared to the neutral control, DMSO.
Protocol
The compounds were screened against Balamuthia mandrillaris following an ATP-bioluminescence based assay for cell growth and survival. For 8-point dose response study, 30 uL of B. mandrillaris (3,000 trophozoites) were added to plated compounds to yield final concentrations spanning from 0.26 uM - 33 uM. Negative controls in the screen plates contained 0.5% DMSO. Assay plates were incubated for 72 h at 37?C B. mandrillaris and at the end of incubation 20 uL of CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) were added in each well of the 96-well plates to induce cell lysis. The resulting ATP-bioluminescence of the trophozoites was measured at room temperature using a Tecan plate reader from PerkinElmer.

ReframeDB	Screening for PLD3 enzyme inhibitors	"PLD3 and PLD4 are endolysosomal exonucleases that appear to behave as negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing. Inhibitors may be useful as immunological adjuvants for vaccine or cancer applications.
Purpose
The screen we have developed has been assessed using the LOPAC library. Our assay relies on the exonuclease activity of PLD3 and PLD4. A short oligonucleotide carrying a fluorescein adduct on one base along with a fluorescence quencher (Iowa Black) on the 3 prime end emits enhanced fluorescence upon digestion by PLD3 or PLD4. Inhibitors will suppress this signal. We plan to introduce into plates that are pre-dotted with compounds to be screened a buffer containing enzyme but no substrate. After a 15 min room temperature incubation, the substrate will be added in an equal volume of butter and the reaction allowed to continue for 2 hours at 37oC. FITC fluorescence is then read. We propose to use PLD3 at 2 nM, PLD4 at 100 nM, and substrate at 2 uM. Final concentration of the ReFrame compound inhibitors will be 2 uM. 
Protocol
Clear 384-well plates are spotted with 10 nl compounds (final conc 2 uM). Then 5 ul enzyme in 1X buffer is added and the plates pre-incubated with compunds for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 5 ul 1X buffer containing fluorogenic substrate (4 uM) is added, and cultured at 37oC for 2 h. One copy of the spotted library will be incubated with 2 uM PLD3, substrate and its optimal buffer. A second copy of the spotted library will be incubated with PLD4, substrate along with its buffer. Assays will be carried out simultaneously to identify selective inhibitors of each isoform.

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of pancreatic cancer tissue from control (EL1) and METTL3-overexpressing (WTg). Overall design: FVB/N-EL1-Luc/EL1-TAg mice (Common Name, EL1-Luc/EL1-TAg, abbreviated as EL1) were used to transgenic mice experiments. Briefly, for co-injection to make EL1-Luc/EL1-TAg, two cDNA was used: the oncogenic cDNAs were prepared from 2.7-kb SV40 Large T-antigen, whereas the reporter cDNAs were prepared from Firefly Luciferase cDNA pGL3-Basic Vector. Each cDNA was fused with rodent pancreatic Elastase I promoter. For the construct of Mettl3 overexpressed transgenic mice, three 6-week-old female BL/6 mice were bled with two 6-week-old male BL/6 mice, and fertilized eggs were taken to perform cDNA injection in vitro to make transgenic animals. For the cDNA injection, the open-reading-flame of Mettl3 was cloned from C57BL/6J mice by PCR, of which sequence were verified; Mettl3 cDNA was fused with chimeric CAG promoter, a composite of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer with the chicken beta actin promoter (CBA). The Mettl3 overexpressing mice were crossed with EL1 mice to make the double transgenic mice (WTg). Mice were confirmed as expected genotype, by PCR. The WTg mice formed abdominal tumors, which were apparent after 6 weeks; the luminous imaging followed to administration of vivoGlo Luciferin as 150 microgram/mouse(g) confirmed the presence of tumor(s) in pancreatic region under the IVIS imaging system (SPI), whereas the opened observation of abdomen indicated around 2-cm tumor(s), and tumors were processed for the preparation of single cells.

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI)	A protocol for the subcellular fractionation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using nitrogen cavitation and density gradient centrifugation.	Most protocols for yeast subcellular fractionation involve the use of mechanical shear forces to lyse the spheroplasts produced by the enzymatic digestion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall. These mechanical homogenization procedures often involve the manual use of devices such as the Dounce homogenizer, and so are very operator-dependent and, in consequence, lack reproducibility. Here, we report a highly reproducible method of homogenizing yeast cells based on nitrogen cavitation. This has been optimized to allow efficient release of subcellular compartments that show a high degree of integrity. The protocol remains effective and reproducible across a range of sample volumes and buffer environments. The subsequent separation method, which employs both sucrose and iodixanol density gradients, has been developed to resolve the major membrane-bound compartments of S. cerevisiae. We present an integrated protocol that is fast, facile, robust and efficient and that will enable 'omics' studies of the subcellular compartments of S. cerevisiae and other yeasts.	{'Omics', 'Microbial collection', 'Laboratory techniques'}	{'Experimental design and studies', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Microbiology'}	0.2	1	5	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	{'Omics', 'Microbial collection'}	{'Experimental design and studies', 'Microbiology'}	0.9103174603174604	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.9103174603174604
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI)	Aberrant DNA methylation in rhabdomyosarcoma	Many pediatric malignancies are embryonal in nature, and one hypothesis for the origin of embryonal tumors is that they arise from a defect in differentiation, either by an inability to terminally differentiate or a reversion to a pluripotent state. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the transition from embryonic stem cell to a more committed cell fate, utilizing both de novo DNA methylation and poised ‘bivalent’ chromatin domains (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) to abolish pluripotency and gain lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics as a cell differentiates. Thus inappropriate epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of bivalent genes required for differentiation could lead to the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. Our broad hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is targeted to a non-random subset of critical pathways used in normal development. This dysregulation of the normal epigenetic program used in development promotes cellular proliferation and provides a mechanism to block differentiation in pediatric cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma. Examination of DNA methylation in fourteen human rhabdomyosarcoma patient samples using RRBS. In addition, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation in one human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) forced to terminally differentiate by expression of the forced heterodimer MyoD~E12 (MDE). Lastly, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation changes during normal differentiation in one primary human normal myoblast cell line	{'DNA', 'Paediatrics', 'Epigenomics'}	{'Oncology', 'Paediatrics', 'Embryology'}	0.2	1	5	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	{'Epigenomics', 'DNA'}	{'Oncology', 'Embryology'}	1.013888888888889	0.0	1.0	1.0	1.013888888888889
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI)	Blood lipids and the incidence of atrial fibrillation: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Framingham Heart Study.	Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Its role in the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.We studied 7142 men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Framingham Heart Study who did not have prevalent AF at baseline and were not on lipid-lowering medications. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using standard procedures. Incident AF during follow-up was identified from hospital discharge codes; review of medical charts; study electrocardiograms; and, in MESA only, Medicare claims. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of AF by clinical categories of blood lipids in each cohort. Study-specific results were meta-analyzed using inverse of variance weighting. During 9.6 years of mean follow-up, 480 AF cases were identified. In a combined analysis of multivariable-adjusted results from both cohorts, high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with lower AF risk (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.87 in those with levels ?60 mg/dL versus <40 mg/dL), whereas high triglycerides were associated with higher risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.05 in those with levels ?200 mg/dL versus <150 mg/dL). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with the risk of AF.In these 2 community-based cohorts, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol were associated with the risk of AF, accounting for other cardiometabolic risk factors.	{'Medical imaging', 'Cardiology', 'Population genomics'}	{'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Cardiology', 'Endocrinology and metabolism'}	0.2	1	5	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	{'Medical imaging', 'Population genomics'}	{'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Endocrinology and metabolism'}	0.901388888888889	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.901388888888889

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI)	Carbapenem Resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and Other Acinetobacter spp. Causing Neonatal Sepsis: Focus on NDM-1 and Its Linkage to ISAba125.	Carbapenem-resistant determinants and their surrounding genetic structure were studied in Acinetobacter spp. from neonatal sepsis cases collected over 7 years at a tertiary care hospital. Acinetobacter spp. (n = 68) were identified by ARDRA followed by susceptibility tests. Oxacillinases, metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs), extended-spectrum ?-lactamases and AmpCs, were detected phenotypically and/or by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Transconjugants possessing the bla NDM-1(New Delhi metallo-?-lactamase) underwent further analysis for plasmids, integrons and associated genes. Genetic environment of the carbapenemases were studied by PCR mapping and DNA sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for sepsis caused by NDM-1-harboring organisms. A. baumannii (72%) was the predominant species followed by A. calcoaceticus (10%), A. lwoffii (6%), A. nosocomialis (3%), A. junni (3%), A. variabilis (3%), A. haemolyticus (2%), and 14TU (2%). Fifty six percent of the isolates were meropenem-resistant. Oxacillinases present were OXA-23-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-51-like, predominately in A. baumannii. NDM-1 was the dominant MBL (22%) across different Acinetobacter spp. Isolates harboring NDM-1 also possessed bla (VIM-2, PER-1, VEB-2, CTX-M-15), armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr genes. bla NDM-1was organized in a composite transposon between two copies of ISAba125 in the isolates irrespective of the species. Further, OXA-23-like gene and OXA-58-like genes were linked with ISAba1 and ISAba3 respectively. Isolates were clonally diverse. Integrons were variable in sequence but not associated with carbapenem resistance. Most commonly found genes in the 5' and 3'conserved segment were aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadB, aadA2, aac4'), non-enzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA1g) and ADP-ribosylation genes (arr2, arr3). Outborn neonates had a significantly higher incidence of sepsis due to NDM-1 harboring isolates than their inborn counterparts. This study demonstrates the significance of both A. baumannii and other species of Acinetobacter in cases of neonatal sepsis over an extended period. Oxacillinases and bla NDM-1 are the major contributors to carbapenem resistance. The dissemination of the bla NDM-1 is likely linked to Tn125 in diverse clones of the isolates.	{'Infectious disease', 'Medical informatics', 'Microbiology'}	{'Infectious disease', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Paediatrics'}	0.2	1	5	0.3333333333333333	0.3333333333333333	{'Medical informatics', 'Microbiology'}	{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Paediatrics'}	0.9847222222222223	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.9847222222222223
Qiita	Bacterial density rather than diversity correlates with hatching success across different avian species	Bacterial communities within avian nests are considered an important determinant of egg viability, potentially selecting for traits that confer embryos with protection against trans-shell infection. A high bacterial density on the eggshell increases hatching failure, whether this effect could be due to changes in bacterial community or just a general increase in bacterial density. We explored this idea using intra- and interspecific comparisons of the relationship between hatching success and eggshell bacteria characterized by culture and molecular techniques (fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing). We collected information for 152 nests belonging to 17 bird species. Hatching failures occurred more frequently in nests with higher density of aerobic mesophilic bacteria on their eggshells. Bacterial community was also related to hatching success, but only when minority bacterial operational taxonomic units were considered. These findings support the hypothesis that bacterial density is a selective agent of embryo viability, and hence a proxy of hatching failure only within species. Although different avian species hold different bacterial densities or assemblages on their eggs, the association between bacteria and hatching success was similar for different species. This result suggests that interspecific differences in antibacterial defenses are responsible for keeping the hatching success at similar levels in different species.	{'Microbial collection', 'Metagenomics', 'Environmental sciences'}	{'Microbial ecology', 'Zoology', 'Embryology'}	0.0	0	6	0.0	0.0	{'Microbial collection', 'Metagenomics', 'Environmental sciences'}	{'Microbial ecology', 'Zoology', 'Embryology'}	0.7944444444444446	0.2	1.0	1.0	0.7944444444444446
